## Data

Two datasets joined on date:

| Dataset | Rows | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| Fear/Greed index | ~500 days | date, classification, value |
| Hyperliquid trades | ~100k trades | account, pnl, size, side, timestamp |

No leverage column in the raw trade data — leverage is derived as a proxy from position size relative to the dataset median.
